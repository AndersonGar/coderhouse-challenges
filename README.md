# coderhouse-challenges
Look the code in the branch with the same name. For example the third challenges is in the branch "challenge3". The challenges 1 and 2 are not in this repo. 

- Challenge 3: Instantiate a projectile of basic way.
- Challenge 4: Shoot projectile with J, K and L keys. I added a coroutine that destroy the projectile 5 seconds later.
